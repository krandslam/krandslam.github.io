Master's student in computer science and engineering, Seoul National University

Hi, I'm Tae Hoon! I am currently a Master's student in computer science and engineering at Seoul National University. I am also a member of  [Bio & Health Informatics Lab](https://bhi-kimlab.github.io/) advised by professor Sun Kim. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Enginnering from [UM-SJTU Joint Insitute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021.

My research interests involve **leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the field of bioinformatics, precision medicine, and drug discovery.** I am deeply engaged in developing AI models that enhance our understanding of genetic variations and their impacts on gene expression, as well as predicting personalized drug responses and identifying promising individual drug candidates. Additionally, I am interested in applying machine learning techniques to innovate drug discovery processes. I believe that these advanced technologies have the potential to accelerate the developement of novel therapeutics, ultimate leading to more effective and personalized healthcare solutions.

In my current research, I am focusing on bridging the gap between *in vitro* and *in vivo* datasets through **bulk tumor deconvolution to improve drug response predictions in clinical settings.** While predicting drug response at the patient level remains a challenging task compared to cell line models, this research seeks to advance these predictions by utilizing generative models for bulk tumor deconvolution. Ultimately, this approach aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of patient-specific drug response predictions, contributing to more personalized and effective treatment strategies.
