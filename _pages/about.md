Master's student in computer science and engineering, Seoul National University

Hi, I'm Tae Hoon! I am currently a Master's student in computer science and engineering at Seoul National University. I am also a member of  [Bio & Health Informatics Lab](https://bhi-kimlab.github.io/) advised by professor Sun Kim. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Enginnering from [UM-SJTU Joint Insitute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021.

My research interests involve **investigating precision medicine in cancer with AI.** I am particularly interested in exploring the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques in predicting cancer progression and response to treatment. I believe that these advanced technologies have the potential to revolutionize our current understanding and approach towards cancer.

In my current research, I am focusing on understanding the relationship between the drug response of cancer cell lines and DNA methylation. Beyond cancer cell lines, I am also actively exploring other promising data sources that can enrich our insights into cancer.

CV is attached!
